  summary:
  "My journey into web development began in 2019 when I started building web apps with Shopify. Since then, I've expanded my skill set and transitioned to React.js in 2020. Eager to enhance my capabilities, I pursued a full-stack web development course at the University of Helsinki in 2022. This comprehensive program covered both frontend and backend development using React.js, Node.js, and python(flask).",
